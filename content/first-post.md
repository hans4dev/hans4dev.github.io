# I am fed up of looking up what I once read and now need!

This is the first post on my new blog.
Id like to convey my motivation and draw you attention to the content to follow soon.
I will add a new post as soon as I learned something new. So you, dear reader, can participate in my journey on a dev's mind.

Stay tuned!
