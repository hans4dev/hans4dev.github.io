    <p><strong>TLDR;</strong> Hi, I am <em>Hans</em> and this is my blog.</p>
<p><img alt="A puzzle of the brain" src="/images/brain-puzzle.jpg"></p>
<p>You may ask ..</p>
<h2>Why is this blog named "Developer Amnesia'?</h2>
<p>Because this is what best describes what happens to us everyday, especially as developer.</p>
<p>Imagine changing a piece of software. Do you remember 6 months later what and why you changed it?
Or when confronted with a problem, knowing the solution, but struggling to convince others. Then you remember this blog post you read someday. Which explains the point clearly and concise. Remembering the URL, finding it by terms or just trying to recall its essentials can be hard and time consuming.</p>
<p>That's akin 'Developers Amnesia', a popular condition among developers like me, and you?</p>
<h2>What content can I expect?</h2>
<p>This blob covers developer related topics like clean-code, design, usability or business related experience.</p>
<h2>Who are you and what is your background?</h2>
<p>I am a software developer loving to automate and write clean designed code. I started programming Pascal and Assembler with a 486 back in 1996 when Modems dialed up into BBS boxes and software was installed from 1.44 MB floppy-disks. It was Y2K when I studied Software Engineering and worked for a big tabular recording company. Since then I went through several positions within IT industry.</p>
<h2>What's your motivation and your target audience?</h2>
<p>Now, with more than 20 years of experience as software developer, I would like to give back and share my knowledge.
Over the years I was motivated myself by reading other peoples source code and learned most when taught by others, from their experience. So my audience is the past me, the developer that wants to read and learn.
Is that you? <strong>I would love to get some feeback or learn something from you!</strong></p>
<h2>What tools do you use to publish this?</h2>
<p>I write Markdown edited in ReText, published by Pelican to my free repository/web-space hosted on Github.
I learned this by following steps in the opensource article <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/5/run-your-blog-github-pages-python">run-your-blog-github-pages-python</a>.</p>
<h2>How can I reach you?</h2>
<p>Leave me a message üê¶ @hansiate.</p>
